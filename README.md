**Project: Aarogya - Patient Registration System for Mirza Health Centre**
Overview
This initial project code implements a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for Mirza Health Centre, a community-centric hospital serving the local populace in Mirza and Kamrup. The system is designed to facilitate efficient patient registration, updates, and modifications in a structured database. Due to confidentiality agreements, the current codebase cannot be shared.

**Getting Started**
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/gauraviiitg/AArogyaversion1.0
cd AArogyaversion1.0

Requirements:
Ensure you have the necessary components installed on your machine:

Java
JDBC Connector
MySQL
Database Setup:

Create the required MySQL database and tables.
Modify the credentials (username, password, and database name) in Real.java.
Run the Application:

javac Real.java
java Real

Aarogya:
A specialized DBMS-based patient registration system catering to the needs of Mirza Health Centre.

**Project Description**:
The system efficiently manages critical patient data including registration ID, patient name, guardian name, date of birth, sex, phone number, address, date, amount paid, and visit details.

**Features**
Pre-determined Values:

Automatic generation of registration ID and date.
Registration ID format: ddmmyyxxxx.

Standard payment: 10/-
Concessions for specific age groups and ANC cases: Amount = 0
There is no charge for the next visit within 1 month.
**Access Levels:**

Level 1: Accessible to receptionists (search queries, data modification).
Level 2: Accessible to office administrators (addition, deletion, and modification of queries).
Queries
Extensive range of search queries with flexible filters.
Dedicated section for frequent queries and overall patient count.
**Problem Solving**
Technical Impairment
Code is optimized for non-technical users with explicit comments and strict input validation.
A comprehensive user manual is provided for ease of use.
**Data Security**
Implemented a secure migration feature: Data export within specified time frames to Excel for internal use.
**Emphasized on offline functionality and strict code security practices to protect sensitive patient data.
Low-Quality Hardware and Software**
Minimized third-party software usage to ensure system stability.
Utilized stable updates and relied on fundamental technologies like basic MySQL and Java to enhance compatibility.
We streamlined the data entry process to accommodate hardware limitations and optimize user efficiency.
